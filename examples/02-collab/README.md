## Setting the Editor's initial state

Because we're using WebRTC in this example, we need to first correctly set the initial state that we want in Reka.

To do this:-

1. Edit the `/src/constants/state.ts` file
2. Run `pnpm encode-initial-state` to generate the initial Yjs update from the constants file.
3. The generated update is stored `/src/generated/encoded-initial-state.ts`. This is then loaded into the Yjs document when the page loads.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
